Install with [x dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool):

    $ dotnet tool install -g x

    $ x new vue-lite ProjectName

### About

This template goal is to provide the richest suite of functionality with the least amount of complexity. 
TypeScript was adopted because it runs as a non-invasive global tool with no dependencies that enables us to use 
the latest JavaScript language features to be able to develop with the same source code as a fully-fledged 
npm webpack build system should you wish to upgrade to one in future.

### Development workflow

All that's needed during development is to run TypeScript in "watch" mode:

    $ tsc -w

Which monitors any changes to any `.ts` files and incrementally compiles their `.js` files on save. ServiceStack's built-in 
[static files](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-single-page-apps#optimal-dev-workflow-with-hot-reloading) hot-reloading detects 
changes to any `.js` files to automatically reload the page, whilst the built-in [dynamic .html page](https://sharpscript.net/docs/hot-reloading) 
monitors for changes to any of its dependent resources.

In a new Terminal window start your .NET Web App HTTP Server with:

    $ dotnet watch run

Using `watch run` will monitor changes to `C#` source files where it will automatically re-build and restart the Server.

After changing your ServiceStack Services, you can re-generate their [Typed TypeScript DTOs](https://docs.servicestack.net/typescript-add-servicestack-reference) with:

    $ x ts

#### Bundling

The integrated `.js` and `.css` bundling is configured to use an fast unminified in-memory bundle for optimal development experience whilst
it utilizes a cached in-memory minified bundle created on first request in production releases. 

Optionally the same bundling configuration can be used in [_bundle.ss](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite/blob/master/wwwroot/_bundle.ss)
to generate and save a more advanced optimized bundle using NUglify with:

    $ x run wwwroot\_bundle.ss

### Publishing and Deployment

The standard .NET Core tools can be used to publish:

    $ dotnet publish -c Release

Then deploy as normal, e.g. via [rsync deployments to Linux](https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-deploy-rsync) or to an 
[AWS EC2 container using Docker](https://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs).
